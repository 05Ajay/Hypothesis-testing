# Hypothesis-testing
Background:
Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.
Objective:
To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.
Data Provided:
•	The theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X
•	Sample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050
•	Number of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units
Assignment Tasks:
1. State the Hypotheses statement:
2. Calculate the Test Statistic:
Use the following formula to calculate the test statistic (t):
where:
•	ˉxˉ = sample mean weekly cost (Rs. 3,050)
•	μ = theoretical mean weekly cost according to the cost model (W = $1,000 + $5X for X = 600 units)
•	σ = 5*25 units
•	n = sample size (25 restaurants)
3. Determine the Critical Value:
Using the alpha level of 5% (α = 0.05), determine the critical value from the standard normal (Z) distribution table.
4. Make a Decision:
Compare the test statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
5. Conclusion:
Based on the decision in step 4, conclude whether there is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests.
